# Account-abstraction-coding-security-specifications
We would like to produce a secure development guide with test cases, which will be presented as a test case code repository with help files. At the same time, we hope to collect as many examples of errors that have occurred or are likely to occur during the use of the Account Abstraction protocol as possible for developers' reference.
